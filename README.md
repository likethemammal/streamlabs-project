### Question Answers

1. How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
    - 4 hours to implement, 4+ hours debugging

2. What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
    - Dealing with some of the bugs that come with a responsive canvas + drag and drop + device pixel ratio.

3. What about this assignment did you find unclear?
    - When the Technical Considerations mentioned not using a "rendering" Canvas library it wasnt clear what the limits on "rendering" were. The example of Fabric.js made it more obvious, but I decided to keep things low-level like the instructions suggested.

4. Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?
    - Yes, but most ppl dont use the Canvas API often.
